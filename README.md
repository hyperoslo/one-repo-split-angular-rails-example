# One Repo Split Angular (Client) & Rails (Backend) setup

An example of how you can integrate angular and rails for simple
applications in just one repo, but without have to mix code between
the client and the backend, or have the client code under /assets
and try to do magic for that code to work together

This is a demo only, so some concepts must be refined, but personally
this has way less magic than making the two apps in one mix file structure/stack
